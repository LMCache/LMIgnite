What is LMCache Cloud?
======================

LMCache Cloud is a product solution that allows users to do 1-click deployment of **vLLM production stack** and **LMCache** as a cloud/on-prem hosted commercial cloud for fast and low latency genAI inference serving. It features a beautiful, intuitive web UI that can be hosted locally, providing easy management and monitoring of your LLM infrastructure across various cloud platforms.

About LMCache
-------------

**LMCache** is an LLM serving engine extension designed to reduce Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and increase throughput, especially under long-context scenarios. For comprehensive documentation, visit the `LMCache documentation <https://docs.lmcache.ai/>`_. By storing the KV caches of reusable texts across various locations including GPU, CPU DRAM, and Local Disk, LMCache reuses the KV caches of any reused text (not necessarily prefix) in any serving engine instance, saving precious GPU cycles and reducing user response delay. According to the `LMCache GitHub repository <https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache>`_, when combined with vLLM, developers achieve 3-10x delay savings and GPU cycle reduction in many LLM use cases, including multi-round QA and RAG.

About vLLM Production Stack
---------------------------

The **vLLM production stack** provides a comprehensive solution for enterprise-scale deployment of large language models in production environments. For detailed deployment instructions and configuration options, visit the `vLLM Production Stack documentation <https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/deployment/integrations/production-stack.html>`_. It offers a complete ecosystem for serving LLMs with high performance, reliability, and scalability, including features like distributed inference, model management, and production-ready APIs. The `vLLM production stack <https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack>`_ is designed to handle the complexities of deploying and managing LLM services at scale, making it ideal for enterprise applications requiring robust, high-throughput inference capabilities.

Key Performance Advantages
---------------------------

The key performance advantage brought by LMCache is the smart caching, migration, and pre-fetching of KV cache that does not need recomputation, especially for long-context scenarios. This intelligent caching mechanism significantly reduces computational overhead and latency by avoiding redundant calculations for previously processed content, making it particularly effective for applications with extensive context requirements.
