Architecture
============

LMCache Cloud is built on a distributed architecture designed for high performance and reliability.

System Components
-----------------

* **Cache Layer**: Distributed caching system for storing model responses
* **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests and routing
* **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances
* **Monitoring**: Real-time performance and health monitoring
* **Storage**: Persistent storage for cache metadata and configurations

Data Flow
---------

1. Client sends request to LMCache Cloud
2. System checks cache for existing response
3. If cached, returns response immediately
4. If not cached, forwards to language model
5. Stores response in cache for future requests
6. Returns response to client
