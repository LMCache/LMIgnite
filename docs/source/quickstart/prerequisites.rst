Prerequisites
=============

Before you begin, make sure you have the following ready. These are required to create clusters and access models with LMIgnite:

1. A MacOS laptop (primary support)
2. Lambda Labs API key
3. (Optional) HuggingFace access token

**OS Support:**

- **MacOS**: Full support with automatic dependency installation
- **Other OS (Windows/Linux)**: Supported if you have `docker compose` installed manually

.. note::
  For non-MacOS users, you'll need to install `docker compose` manually before proceeding with the installation.

1. Get a Lambda Labs API Key
----------------------------

To launch and manage cloud GPU instances, you'll need a Lambda Labs API key:

#. Go to https://lambda.ai/ and **Sign Up** (or **Log In** if you already have an account).
#. In the left sidebar, click **API Keys**.
#. Click **Generate API Key**, give it a name, and copy the key (e.g., `secret_xxx`).
#. Save your key somewhere safeâ€”you won't be able to see it again!

2. Get a Hugging Face Access Token
----------------------------------

To access models from the Hugging Face Hub:

#. Go to https://huggingface.co/login and **Sign Up** (or **Log In**).
#. Visit https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens.
#. Click **+ Create new token**, choose **Read** as the type, give it a name (e.g., "lmignite"), and click **Create token**.
#. Copy your token (e.g., `hf_xxx`) and save it somewhere safe.

.. note::
   Some models on Hugging Face are "gated" and require you to request access on the model card page. Approval may be automatic or manual.

Done!

Once you have your API key and token, you're ready to proceed!
