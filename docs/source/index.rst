**Deploy LLMs to your own cluster & cloud via web browser ðŸš€**

LMIgnite ignites your cluster with LLM deployments. It is your one-click solution to deploy high-performance, enterprise-grade LLM serving infrastructure into your own cluster and cloud environments.

Why LMIgnite?
-------------

- **Self-hosted**: You run your LLM with your own machines. It's cheap and private.
- **High-performance**: Deep integration with open-source LLM projects like vLLM, LMCache, and vLLM production stack.
- **Easy-to-use**: Deploy LLMs just by your browser.
- **One-click runnable**: Run the install script and the deployment web UI pops up for you.
- **3-10x faster**: Thanks to LMCache and orchestration optimizations.
- **Enterprise-ready**: Multi-tenancy, autoscaling, high availability.
- **Wide support**: AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda, and on-premises.
- **Built-in monitoring**: Performance analytics included.
